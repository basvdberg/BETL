# BETL for Azure
BETL for Azure is a complete revision of BETL. BETL is an ETL Engine, which in my world is a synonym for data warehouse automation software, etl generation tool or ETL generation framework. 
Nowadays everybody uses an ETL engine to generate ETL by using meta data. There are some commercial products like WhereScape, XpertBI, TimeXtender or I-Refactory, but I prefer to keep matters into my own hands and my experience is that commercial products don't give you the flexibility to build the ETL engine exactly how you want. 

BETL is licensed under the GNU GPL, so feel free to dive into the source code and make your own extensions. My hope is that by sharing this knowledge we can all benefit from each other. And perhaps someday I can sell myself as a betl consultant.

BETL for Azure is made for Azure, but can also be modified for an on premise environment. However there is a T-SQL dependency, so other databases that Microsoft will be difficult.
